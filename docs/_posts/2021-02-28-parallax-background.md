title: Parallax background
---

The last remaining graphical element with a boring default is the background. This was just set
to black, which looks extremely low-effort. Even though our character is some sort of space alien,
it just doesn't look inviting.

I went back to the [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) assets and picked up a background sprite, which looks
like this:

<img src="https://github.com/timmartin/generic-platformer/raw/v0.1.1/src/assets/background.png"
    alt="Background"
    width="512"
    height="512"
 />
