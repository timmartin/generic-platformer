The last remaining graphical element with a boring default is the background. This was just set
to black, which looks extremely low-effort. Even though our character is some sort of space alien,
it just doesn't look inviting.

I went back to the [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) assets and picked up a background sprite, which looks
like this:
